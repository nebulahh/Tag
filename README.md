**Link To Project:** https://tag-pr90.onrender.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDb, Express, Mongoose
I organised the application using the MVC, using ejs for my views because of the few syntax required to learn. I also used Bcrypt to secure user password. i used email passport auth to authenticate the user.

## Optimization

I would implement google sign in option, there are still more work to do on the user interaction. when the logged in user clicks on another usernames, it should display there profile but it only display the logged in user data but i will do it given time.

## Lesson Learned

How to implement the MVC for a full stack website. I learnt how to use Mongoose, Bcrypt, Passport auth, and the complexity that comes with social media sites.
